# About the Photographer/Mission Statement

Hey world I'm [Scott Cramer][0]. All of the photography you see posted on this website was captured by me during my journey: 6 continents and 20 countries...so far. Travel is one of the great blessings in my life and has illuminated the glorious splendor of existence to me in many ways: 

Human beings, despite our differences in appearance, beliefs, histories, and culture are all beautiful; sharing the equal capacity for love, compassion, kindness, harmony, and peace. The natural world, despite its' propensity to rage against our existence on this planet, is unfathomable in its depth and grandeur, deserving our utmost respect, reverence, and conservation. The wildlife that share our planet have every right to thrive and be protected from man's destructive tendencies. 

I am convinced from all the experiences that I have gathered along the trail that spreading love, peace, positive energy, and sustainable means of co-existence is life's great purpose. Any photo you see posted here can be sold provided you share in this same ideal. Reward yourself with a fine art print while simultaneously helping those in need, endangered wildlife, or our rapidly changing environment. 

Obtain my artwork through donating to your chosen cause, non-profit, or charity... it's that simple: Each day we rise and have potential to do great and inspiring things for others. If you are inspired by my work and inspired to do awesome things for others, I am stoaked to do "business" with you.  

Initially when I started 5050photography back in 2013 my dream was to sell fine art photographic prints and split 50% of each sale with the charity of the purchasers choosing (hence the name). But as time went on I realized that money has zero influence on my happiness and would be best served completely going to the charity you are passionate about supporting... So begins 5050photography's new chapter!: 100% to your cause. guaranteed! (its guaranteed because you personally are making the donation. Donate what you think the photo is worth to your cause and show me the screenshot confirmation or email the receipt) All I need is money to cover the cost of the print and shipping... Thats the deal people.(contact: scottcramer@5050photography.org for more information) 

Love to you and yours,

Scott
