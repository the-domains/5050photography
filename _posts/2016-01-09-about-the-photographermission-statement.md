# About the Photographer/Mission Statement

My name is Scott Cramer. 100% of the photography posted on this website was captured during the journeys of my life thus far: 6 continents and 20 countries. Travel is one of the great blessings in my life and has illuminated the splendor of existence in so many ways: Human beings, despite our differences in appearance, beliefs, histories, and cultures are all beautiful; sharing the equal capacity for love, compassion, kindness, harmony, and peace. That the natural world, despite its' propensity to rage against our existence on this planet, is unfathomable in its depth and grandeur, and deserves our utmost respect, reverence, and conservation. That the wildlife that share our planet have every right to thrive and be protected from man's destructive tendencies.  I am convinced from all the experiences that I have gathered along the trail that spreading love, peace, positive energy, and sustainable means of co-existence is life's great purpose. Anything you see posted can be sold (at cost to me) provided you share in this same ideal. Reward yourself by helping others, wildlife, or the environment. Obtain my artwork through donating to your chosen cause, non-profit, or charity... it's that simple. Each day we rise and have potential to do great and inspiring things for others. If you are inspired by my work and inspired to do awesome things for others, I am stoaked to do "business" with you.  Initially when I started 5050photography back in 2013 my dream was to sell fine art photographic prints and split 50% of each sale with the charity of the purchasers choosing. But as time went on I realized that money has zero influence on my happiness and would be best served completely going to the charity you are passionate about supporting... So begins 5050photography's new chapter!: 100% to your cause guaranteed! All I need is money to cover the cost of the print and shipping... Thats the deal people. All the best to you and yours.
