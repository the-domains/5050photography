I am convinced that spreading love and positive energy is life's great purpose. Anything you see posted can be sold (at cost to me) provided you share in this same ideal. Reward yourself by helping others, wildlife, or the environment. Obtain my artwork through donating to your favorite charity... its that simple. Each day we rise and have potential to do great and inspiring things for others. If you are inspired by my work and inspired to do awesome things for others I am stoaked to do "business" with you.

Initially when I started 5050photography back in 2013 my dream was to sell fine art photographic prints and split 50% of each sale with the charity of the purchasers choosing. But as time went on I realized that money has zero influence on my happiness and would be best served completely going to the charity you are passionate about supporting. So begins 5050photography's new chapter:**100% to your cause guaranteed** All I need is money to cover the cost of the print and shipping... Thats the deal people.
