My name is Scott Cramer and 100% of the photography posted on this website were taken during my recent travels: 6 continents and 20 countries. Travel is one of the great blessings in my life and has illuminated the beauty of existence to me in so many ways: That human beings, despite our differences in appearance, beliefs, history, traditions, and values are all beautiful; sharing the same capacity for love, compassion, kindness, and peace. That the natural world, despite its propensity to rage against our existence on this planet, is unfathomable in its depth and grandeur, and deserves our utmost respect, reverence, and conservation. That the wildlife that share our planet have every right to thrive and be protected from man's destructive tendencies.
